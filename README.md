# flask_authnz
A small utility for authentication/authorization for flask based services

This utility supplies a couple of decorators that are used for PCDS authentication/authorization.

#### Basic Usage.
In your Flask context object create a DAL and a security object passing it the application name (in the example, _LogBook_)  
```
from flask_mysql_util import MultiMySQL
from flask_authnz import FlaskAuthnz, UserGroups
roles_db = MySQLRoles(MultiMySQL(prefix="ROLES")
security = FlaskAuthnz(roles_db, UserGroups), "LogBook")
```

As this uses the MySQL database for roles, you'd need to set up your environment accordingly (see the documentation for flask_mysql_util).

In your `start.py`, don't forget to initialize the database connection.
`roles_db.init_app(app)`
 

You can then mark your flask blueprint endpoints with decorators to indicate the need for authentication/authorization.
For example, 
```
@logbook_service_blueprint.route("/processing_definitions/<experiment_id>", methods=["GET"])
@context.security.authentication_required
@context.security.authorization_required("read")
def processing_definitions(experiment_id):
```
- The order of the decorators is important.
- For experiment based authorization, it is important that the method takes in an argument called `experiment_id` that contains the experiment_id.
- Authorization is based on privileges; so in this example, you are allowing those with the `read` privilege to get the `processing_definitions`
- The application will load and cache the privileges -> role mapping on startup.
- When an authorization request is made, we get a set of roles for the user and a set of roles that contain this privilege. The user is authorized if the intersection of these two sets is non-empty.
